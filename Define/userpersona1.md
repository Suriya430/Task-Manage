Profile Summary
A high school student balancing a foundational academic load with the external responsibility of a part-time job. They are digitally native but suffer from "app fatigue," preferring streamlined, low-friction tools over complex productivity systems. They currently lack a formal organization system, relying instead on mental effort to track their life.

Demographics & Environment
Role: High School Student (Grade 10–12).

Academic Load: Mandatory core curriculum (Math, English, Social Studies) including high-intensity lab sciences like Chemistry.

Employment: Holds a part-time job with shifts that likely vary or compete with evening study time.

Tech Literacy: High, but prefers simplicity; uses a smartphone primarily for communication and social media, not currently for task management.

Daily Schedule & Routine
Morning/Afternoon: Follows a rigid, 6–7 hour school day at a physical campus.

Late Afternoon/Evening: Transitions quickly between school, commuting, and work shifts.

Late Night: The "danger zone" where homework is finally addressed after work, often leading to late-night realizations about neglected tasks.

Current Behaviors
Tracking Method: Purely internal/mental. No physical planner, digital calendar, or dedicated to-do list app is currently in use.

Information Intake: Receives deadlines from teachers and work schedules from managers, but stores them as "mental bookmarks" rather than documented entries.

Pain Points & Frustrations
Last-Minute Stress: Frequently experiences the "jolt" of remembering a deadline or a shift at the final hour.

Mental Overload: Constant low-level anxiety from trying to keep a running tally of tasks in their head.

Resistance to Complexity: Finds traditional "productivity" apps too time-consuming to set up or maintain, leading back to the cycle of memory-based tracking.

Lack of Visualization: Cannot easily see the "overlap" between their school deadlines and their work hours until they are in the middle of a conflict.

User Goals
Reduce Cognitive Load: Move tasks out of their head and into a trusted space without spending more than a few seconds on data entry.

Proactive Awareness: Shift from "remembering at the last second" to "seeing it coming."

Streamlined Experience: A tool that feels like an assistant, not an extra class or a second job.
