# Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview
**Product Name:** Loom
**Elevator Pitch:** Loom is a minimalist scheduling assistant that instantly bridges the gap between school deadlines and work shifts, helping students visualize their true free time and break down "mountain-sized" tasks before the last-minute panic sets in.

## Target User
**Persona:** The Overwhelmed Minimalist
**Role:** High School Student (Grade 10–12) balancing a foundational academic load (including high-intensity lab sciences) with a part-time job.
**Context & Constraints:** They are digitally native but suffer from "app fatigue," preferring streamlined, low-friction tools over complex productivity systems. They currently lack a formal organization system, relying instead on mental effort to track their life. Their daily schedule involves rigid school hours, quick transitions to work shifts, and a late-night "danger zone" for homework.
**Goals:** Reduce cognitive load by moving tasks out of their head instantly, gain proactive awareness of upcoming deadlines, and use a tool that feels like an assistant rather than an extra chore.
**Frustrations:** Frequent last-minute stress from forgotten deadlines, constant low-level anxiety from mental tracking, resistance to complex productivity apps, and an inability to visualize the overlap between school and work schedules.

## Problem Statement
The Overwhelmed Minimalist is a busy student managing high-stakes academics and a job who needs a way to visualize their tasks as small, manageable actions because viewing assignments as "one big mountain" triggers a stress response that leads to avoidance and procrastination.

Furthermore, they need an immediate, low-effort way to offload mental bookmarks because the belief that they "have time later" creates a false sense of security that eventually collapses into high-cortisol panic.

*Evidence:* User interviews reveal a "Freeze Response" when faced with academic "mountains." To cope with the resulting cortisol spike, they use social media as a physiological stress-blocker. The core failure of current methods is a false sense of security ("I have time") that masks the reality of a rigid work-school schedule.

## Proposed Solution
Loom solves the procrastination loop by providing an ultra-low-friction way to capture tasks and a unified view of the user's entire life (school + work). 

**Core Approach & Key Differentiator:** Unlike traditional to-do lists that require extensive categorization, Loom focuses on speed of entry and visual overlap. Its key differentiator is the "Unified School-Work Timeline," which explicitly shows students where their actual free time exists between their rigid school and work commitments, preventing the "I have time later" illusion.

## Scope
**In Scope for v1 (MVP Must-Haves):**
*   **Unified School-Work Timeline:** A single, high-contrast visual feed that overlays class deadlines with work shift hours to reveal "True Free Time."
*   **The "3-Second" Quick Dump:** A prominent, persistent button for typing a task name and date/time without mandatory categories or tagging.
*   **The "Mountain Crusher" (Basic Breakdown):** A simple prompt upon task creation asking, "What is the 5-minute version of this?" to transform large tasks into achievable starts.
*   **Shift-Aware Nudges:** Smart notifications triggered by the gap between school and work (e.g., "You have a 2-hour window before your 5 PM shift to start your Chem pre-lab").

**Out of Scope for v1 (Explicitly Excluded):**
*   **Social & Community Features (Study Squads):** Real-time streaming or social layers add technical complexity and potential distraction.
*   **AI Academic Coaching:** Building a tutor for specific subjects is a massive undertaking; Loom v1 is a logistics tool, not a tutoring tool.
*   **Resume Builder/History Export:** A "nice-to-have" that doesn't solve the immediate nightly "cortisol spike."

## Success Criteria
1.  **The "Mental Dump" Efficiency (Time-to-Action):** Average time from app launch to task creation completion is < 5 seconds.
2.  **Procrastination Index (Start-Time Lead):** A 20% increase in the average "Lead Time" (the gap between task creation and when it is marked "In Progress" or "Complete") over a 30-day period.
3.  **Shift-Collision Avoidance (Retention through Utility):** 40% Click-Through Rate (CTR) on proactive "Shift-Aware Nudges" (study-window notifications).

## Vision Summary
The Overwhelmed Minimalist is a high school student drowning in the mental overhead of balancing rigorous academics and a part-time job. They rely on fragile "mental bookmarks" because traditional productivity apps are too complex, leading to a cycle of procrastination, false security, and late-night panic. Existing solutions fail because they treat school and work as separate silos and demand too much setup time. Loom fills this gap by providing a 3-second task dump and a unified timeline that visually overlaps school and work, acting as a low-friction assistant that breaks down "mountains" and reveals true free time before the panic sets in.
